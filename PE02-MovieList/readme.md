# Input:
The input for this React project consists of an array of movie objects, each containing information about the movie's title, genre, and release year. Additionally, the user interacts with a genre dropdown that allows them to filter the list of movies based on their selected genre.

# Process:
The app processes the userâ€™s genre selection using the 'useState' hook to filter the list of movies accordingly. The dropdown menu dynamically updates with all unique genres from the movie list, and when the user selects a genre, the movie list is filtered to only show movies from that genre. Additionally, an 'onClick' event is used to display an alert with the movie title when a movie is clicked.

# Output:
The output of the app is a filtered movie list displayed on the screen based on the selected genre. Each movie is presented with its title, genre, and release year. When a user clicks on a movie, an alert appears showing the movie's title, providing an interactive experience.
