## Input
The "MyResume" web app takes static data as input to showcase a user's resume. This data includes the individual's name, contact details, educational background, skills, work experience, and project information. These details are hardcoded into the `Resume.js` file as structured JavaScript objects or arrays, which the app uses to populate the visual layout dynamically.

## Process
The application is developed using React and styled with CSS. The main component, `Resume.js`, organizes the resume's content into sections such as Contact Information, Education, Skills, Work Experience, and Projects. The layout and styling are handled by `Resume.css`, which ensures the design aligns with the specified requirements, such as the rgba(#bdfb04) background color, black text, and appropriate margins and fonts. The `Resume.js` component is imported into the `App.js` file, where it is rendered to display the resume. React ensures efficient DOM updates for a smooth user experience.

## Output
The output is a visually appealing web page that displays a well-structured resume. The page features a greenish background (`rgba(#bdfb04)`), black text, and formatted sections. Each section is clearly demarcated, ensuring readability and alignment with the design specifications. Users can view all the resume information in a single, aesthetically pleasing interface hosted via Codespaces.
